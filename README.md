# Portfolio Website (Learning & Experiments)

This repo is where im building my personal portfolio website while also practicing web development.  
im using it to keep track of how much i remember, experiment with new ideas, and try out different approaches as i learn!

## Purpose
- Practice and improve my HTML & CSS skills for the time being
- Experiment with layouts, styling, and new techniques since im self taught
- Track my progress as i move from a simple site to a complete portfolio hopefully 

## Current Status
- Basic pages and styling created  
- Adding features and experimenting as i go  

## Future Plans
- Making sure the site is fully responsive  
- Add interactive elements (maybe js stuff later)  
- Polish the design and correct any mistakes i might have missed
